The "SIMPLE LOGIC" approach to sudoku requires only visual
analysis and goes something like this:
âž¢ Can the 2 go in the empty square? It can't, because box 2
already has a 2, and it can only have one of each number. Can
the 7 go there? Row 3 already has its 7, so we can't put a 7
there, either. That leaves us with the 6. Neither row 3 nor box
2 already has a 6, so we know the 6 is correct for that cell.
We've solved our first number!
